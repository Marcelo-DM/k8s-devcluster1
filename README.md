## k8s-devcluster1
This repository uses vagrant to deploy a local five node Kubernetes cluster in VirtualBox.

## IMPORTANT
All files located inside the vagrant directory were not created by me. Some edits have been made but all credit should be directed to https://github.com/mmumshad/kubernetes-the-hard-way. This project provided the ability to quickly create a test environment without too much thought.
