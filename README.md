## k8s-devcluster1
This repository uses vagrant to deploy a local five node Kubernetes cluster in VirtualBox.

## IMPORTANT
Everything located inside the vagrant directory was not created by me. Some edits were 
made but all credit should be directed to https://github.com/mmumshad/kubernetes-the-hard-way.
This project provided the ability to quickly create a test environment, albeit it is a little 
different from the project.
